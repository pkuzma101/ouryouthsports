An uncomplicated event manager with a highly customisable (developer-friendly) front-end calendar utilising CLNDR.js.

== Description ==

A handsome, fully featured event calendar for your Wordpress site. Developers: look no further, the highly appraised CLNDR.js is now here at your disposal on Wordpress straight out of the box. Tweak the CLNDR.js options and fine-tune the master stylesheet and Bob's your uncle - a painlessly elegant calendar for use in any page/post or widget. With a simple event manager bundled in, you'll be on your way in seconds without the need of any third party apps or services trying to charge a premium just for the use of the sidebar widget.

**Usage**

Use the *Instances* page to create and modify different displays of your events. Based on the name you chose for your instance, a shortcode will be generated (and shown in the table) for use in any page, post or "Text" widget content field. Each instance can each have a different CLNDR.js template and include more JS options, so the event display could range from a full calendar to a text list of each event.

**Not a developer?**

Not to worry, the plugin comes pre-shipped with a couple of front-end calendar instances to get you on your way. For most people, the default options won't need editing, and all that will need to be done is to edit the master stylesheet to change the colours to match your theming. If you don't know CSS, this is a great opportunity to get your fingers very slightly dirty - the section of the stylesheet you'll want to edit is fully commented with which colours do what.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What options can I change when displaying the calendar? =

If you're a developer, the world is your oyster - head on over to the documentation for [CLNDR.js](https://github.com/kylestetz/CLNDR#usage "CLNDR.js"). The templating and method options can be changed on the Instances page in the plugin.

= ...But I'm not a developer... =

Not to worry, the plugin comes pre-shipped with a couple of front-end calendar instances to get you on your way. For most people, the default options won't need editing, and all that will need to be done is to edit the master stylesheet to change the colours to match your themeing. If you don't know CSS, this is a great opportunity to get your fingers very slighly dirty - the section of the stylesheet you'll want to edit is fully commented with which colours do what. It's easy I promise - Google is your friend.

= Is this in [my language]? =

Unless that language is English, at the moment I am afraid not. However, whilst the plugin itself isn't translated, there is the option to set the locale, ensuring you get month and day names in your chosen language and format when outputting the calendar. The plugin itself is actually set up to be internationalised, so if you're able to provide a translation, I'd love to hear from you.

= What other features are in the pipeline? =

I created Event CLNDR because I needed it and thought others might too. I don't intend to enhance it any time soon unless I find more time, inclination and desire from the user base. If you still want to suggest a feature, of course the support forum is a great place to start. If it perks my interest you never know...

= Are you looking for contributors? =

With the above said, I'd be happy to get others involved if there are other devs who see potential for growth. Just get in touch.

= This is exactly what I was looking for! How can I thank you? =

Well, I'm pleased you like it. As they say, money talks - please use the donate button to show any gratitude (especially if you're one of those guys with a company credit card ;) )

= This is rubbish/it doesn't work. How can I show my dissatisfaction? =

Hmmm, I guess you could leave me a negative review, but that wouldn't be too kind considering this is my first plugin and I only released it to try and help folks who were in my situation to save a bit of time. If you really must shout please head over the forum and make it constructive :)
